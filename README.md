# The Athtech Challenge - or Tr(h)ackathon!

Enclosed are initial datasets for [AthTech Challenge 2025](https://athtech.run/2025/hackathon.html)

This repository contains data relating to the European Championships in Rome, 2024. 
- A top level JSON file contains the full results of every heat, semi-final and final, including reaction times and every jump and throw.
- a PDF calendar showing the times of day for each event (since the results do not include this)
- a subdirectory with a profile of each participating athlete or relay team, and their past racing history up to June 2024

Thanks to [Tilastopaja](https://www.tilastopaja.info/) for providing the files.

We reserve the right to add more data if we can obtain it.  We are still hoping to obtain more precise timing and splits data, for example.  If we obtain more data, we will notify the [forum](https://forum.openathletics.net/).

For any questions or to register your interest, please [come onto our forum](forum.openathletics.net) and start a thread or add to the challenge thread
