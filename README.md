# The Athtech Challenge - or Tr(h)ackathon!

Enclosed are initial datasets for AthTech Challenge 2025.  Background is [here](https://athtech.run/2025/hackathon.html)

# The challenge
This repository contains data relating to the European Championships in Rome, 2024.
A top level JSON file contains the full results of every heat, semi-final and final, including reaction times and every jump and throw.

It does NOT contain the time of day on each event, which may be useful for linking to social media sources at the time; so we have included the published timetable as a PDF.

Your challenge is to "do something cool".

Some ideas...
- linking to external data
- new ways of visualising the action

# What to deliver
You can deliver a presentation, a document, or a proof-of-concept in the form of a website.  It needs to be accessible on the public web.

# The process

1. Register your interest by starting a thread on htps://forum.openathletics/net/.  Tell us about your ideas.  This doesn't commit you to going ahead.
2. Be ready for an interim check-in around 14 July.  We can either meet you online 1:1, or you can give a short 5-minute update during a public online meeting, as you prefer.
3. Submit your project by 1st September
4. Be ready for an on-screen presentation to the judges in the first two weeks of September

# The prize
The winning team will receive tickets to the next European Championships (Birmingham, UK, 2026); AND up will be invited to present in person at AthTech, with all expenses (from within Europe) covered by European Athletics.
