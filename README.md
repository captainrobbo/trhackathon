# The Athtech Challenge - or Tr(h)ackathon!

Enclosed are initial datasets for [AthTech Challenge 2025](https://athtech.run/2025/hackathon.html)

This repository contains data relating to the European Championships in Rome, 2024. 
- A top level JSON file contains the full results of every heat, semi-final and final, including reaction times and every jump and throw.
- a PDF calendar showing the times of day for each event (since the results do not include this)
- a subdirectory `athletes`with a profile of each participating athlete or relay team, and their past racing history up to June 2024
- a subdirectoty `isolynx` containing the live tracking data, with the position and acceleration of every athlete sampled at 0.1 second intervals in most races.

Thanks to [Tilastopaja](https://www.tilastopaja.info/) for providing the Athlete files, which were extracted by an API call to their system, and then filtered to show only results up to the right time.

Thanks to [Matsport](https://www.matsport.com/) for providing the low level [IsoLynx](https://isolynx.finishlynx.com/) tracking data.

We reserve the right to add more data if we can obtain it.  We are still hoping to obtain more precise timing and splits data, for example.  If we obtain more data, we will notify the [forum](https://forum.openathletics.net/).
